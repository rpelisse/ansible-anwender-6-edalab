README
====

This is the material used for a small lab around [Event Driven Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/blog/event-driven-ansible-is-here/) delivered at the [Ansible Anwendertreffen NÂ°6](https://www.ansible-anwender.de/post/2024/09/register/). The presentation of the labs can by rendered (for terminal) using [Slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides).

The lab uses a small [Java Webapp (EDA APP)](https://github.com/rpelisse/eda-app/) and also leverage the [Ansible Collection for Wildfly](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/wildfly/). It requires a fair knowledge of Ansible.
